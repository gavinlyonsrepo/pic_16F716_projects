* Name: ADC to Seven segment
* Description: A program to display an 8-bit ADC value(0-255) in a 4-digit seven segment display (SMA420564) makes use of timer0 interrupt feature to read the value. A pot is connected to the
Analog input of the pic16F716.

The 8-bit ADC (0 to 255) value is read from a pot attached to pin RA0.
Is then displayed on the 4-digit seven segment display (digit one(MSB) is always zero)
The value is read on a interrupt generated by overflow of timer0.
The pot could easily be replaced by many types of sensors. 

PortB is connected to the anodes of the SMA420564,
With exception of RB7 which is not connected. 
The Decimal point pin on SMA420564 is not connected as its not needed for this application. 
PortA is connected to the common cathodes of each digit thru a transistor switch.
with exception of RA0 which is connected to the pot.
RA4 requires a 10K pullup resistor to function as digital output here
as it is Open drain when configured as output.

MCLR pin is tied high thru a pullup. as it is the active low reset. 

The clock is 16Mhz. The ADC is read on the timer0 overflow interrupt.

1. Clock Source in Mhz	16	Mhz			
2. Fosc   	16000000	Hz			
3. Fosc / 4	4000000	Hz			
4. Time Period	2.5E-07	sec			
5. Prescaler	256				
6. Timer0 Interrupt Period	0.016384	sec			
7. Frequency	61.03515625	Hz			
8. Period of Frequency Input To Timer0	6.4E-05	sec			
9. Period of Time for each Timer0 Count	0.016384	sec			
					
10. Preload (TMR0 value)	6				
11. Delay (Timer0 Period with Preload)	0.016	sec		0.016	sec

The timer interrupts overflows every .016 mS and a incremental counter refresh's display every second approx.

By using a shift register the number of pins needed to drive 4 digit 7-seg could be reduced from 12 to 8.

NOTE: For schematic the pin number labels on 4-digit 7-segment are wrong: Use the pin numbers in table above 
or just use the pin name(letter) labels on part which are correct.
